# Composer Preview

A [Flarum](http://flarum.org) extension. Preview the content of a new discussion while creating it in the composer.

Originally this extension was been created by @simonxeko (see [discussion](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/22636-preview-discussion-post-wip)). Glowing Blue then took the original idea and created a new implementation that works with the latest version of Flarum and is more seamlessly integrated into the existing `flarum/core` code. Glowing Blue no longer had the need to maintain this, and so I, @010101 have taken over as the maintainer.
